# WebOwl-Hacktoberfest22
 This repo is for HackToBerFest22. The repo is a CTF security challenge where the user can ping any server and find the response code. Unfortunately, the developer is using shell script for this to make things easier. Here the attacker can read the internal files of server. Your task is to identify the issue from the code and make sanitizations. 
 Make sure to solve the code and test it where the sanitization is laking what area needs to be improved. I will accept ccommits which work on the best solution for sanitization, not the alternative solutions using other libraries. The main topic deals with the sanitization. 
 The main code is inside the webowl dir where the app is present. This is a django application.
