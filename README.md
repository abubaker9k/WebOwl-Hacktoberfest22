# WebOwl-Hacktoberfest22
 This repo is for HackToBerFest22. The repo is a CTF security challenge where the user can ping any server and find the response code. Unfortunately, the developer is using shell script for this to make things easier. Here the attacker can read the internal files of server. Your task is to identify the issue from the code and make sanitizations. We assume that the code is being run in Linux server.
